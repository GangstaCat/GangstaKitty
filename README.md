Hi! I'm GangstaCat and I'm happy to see you here.

If you were wondering what this repository is, it is for my discord bot, GangstaKitty.
I wanted to make this bot open source since i know i'm ot the best programmer and that there are a lot of people that can make my bot better.

I would be very thankful if you'd improve the bot by adding a new command, event handler, etc. There are some simple rules though.

1: No NSFW features. this bot is holy
2: No music features with YouTube videos. If this bot ever gets popular I don't want it ending the same fate as Rythm or Groovy.
3: No malicious stuff like randomly sending phishing links, malware downloads, etc.
3: please DM GangstaCat#0458 on Discord if you have made any new changes.

Looks simple right? I hope that's all you need to help me improve this bot. Have a good day!
